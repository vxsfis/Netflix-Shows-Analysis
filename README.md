**Netflix Titles Data Analysis (Excel Portfolio Project)**



**Project Overview**

This project explores the Netflix Titles dataset using Excel to demonstrate key skills in data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and visualization. The aim is to analyze the diversity of Netflix’s content by genre, release year, country, and rating.



**Objectives**

\- *Identify* the top genres on Netflix.

\- *Visualize* genre trends over time.

\- *Analyze* genre production by country.

\- *Explore* content ratings distribution.



**Method**

\- *Data Cleaning*: Python was used to explode the genre column and remove missing values, ensuring a clean dataset for Excel analysis.

\- *Excel Analysis*: PivotTables and charts were used to answer the project objectives and visualize insights.



**Key Findings**

\- *Top Genres:* 'International Movies' and 'Dramas' are the most common genres.

\- *Trends Over Time:* Dramas and International Movies have grown steadily over the past decade.

\- *Country \& Genre*: India and the US are leading producers for multiple genres.

\- *Ratings:* TV-MA and TV-14 are the most frequent ratings, reflecting Netflix’s diverse audience.

**Actionable Business Solutions**



\- *Expand Investment in Leading Genres:* Since 'International Movies' and 'Dramas' show both volume and growth, Netflix should continue to invest in these genres and promote new releases heavily.

\- *Diversify Genre Offerings by Country:* With India and the US leading in content production, partnering with creators in emerging markets or countries with unique genre strengths can help diversify the catalog and attract new subscribers.

\- *Optimize Family and Mature Content Mix:* The dominance of TV-MA suggests a mature audience, but given a strong showing for TV-14, Netflix could develop targeted campaigns and acquire more family-friendly titles to expand its user base.

\- *Localized Marketing:* Use genre and country insights to tailor marketing strategies by region, promoting genres that resonate locally.

\- *Content Gaps as Opportunities:* Identify underrepresented genres or countries in the catalog and consider targeted acquisitions or original productions to fill those gaps.
